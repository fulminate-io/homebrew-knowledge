# Homebrew formula for knowledge-server — the local graph server for Knowledge.
#
# The long-lived graph server (closed-source, garble-obfuscated). The
# `knowledge` daemon (the separate `knowledge` formula) connects to it on
# :15022 when you run fully local (not logged in to Fulminate Cloud) and for
# sync. Run it as its own `brew services` background service alongside
# `knowledge` — Homebrew is one service per formula, so this is a second
# formula with its own launchd job.
#
# Pre-built download (no Go toolchain needed): darwin-arm64, linux-amd64,
# linux-arm64. There is no darwin-amd64 (Intel) build.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      knowledge-server is the local graph server. Start it (as your user — do
      NOT use sudo) alongside the knowledge daemon:

        brew services start knowledge-server

      Logs: #{var}/log/knowledge-server.log

      Credentials live in the [credentials] section of ~/.knowledge/config
      (see the `knowledge` formula's caveats).
